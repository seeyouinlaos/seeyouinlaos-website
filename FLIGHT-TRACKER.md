# Flight Tracker — Travel Service (production architecture)

A real flight-price tracker for the See You In Laos wedding website. Guests save a
**search strategy** (route, flexible dates, trip length, budget, alert threshold);
the app tracks the **best real fare** over time, shows a dashboard/history/portfolio,
and can alert when a fare drops below a threshold.

**No prices are simulated.** Fares, airlines, flight numbers, times, connections,
baggage and cabin classes come from a real provider (**Duffel**) through a
replaceable adapter.

## Platform

Deployed as a **Cloudflare Worker with static assets** (Workers + Assets). One
Worker both serves the static site (via the `ASSETS` binding) and runs the backend
API + daily cron — which is what lets Cloudflare attach Secrets like
`DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN`. (A static-assets-only deployment cannot hold Secrets.)

## Architecture

```
Browser UI (flight-tracker.html)         ← never holds an API token
        │  POST /api/travel
        ▼
Cloudflare Worker (src/worker.js)
        │  fetch()  → Travel Service (API)      scheduled() → daily cron
        ▼
Travel Service (src/lib/travelService.js)
        │  validates, normalizes, owns the "best combination" rule,
        │  and builds the flexible-date landscape from searchOffers
        ▼
Provider Adapter (src/lib/providers/duffelAdapter.js  implements  flightProvider.js)
        │  the ONLY provider-specific code — swappable behind the interface
        ▼
Duffel Flight Offers API
```

- **Business logic stays in the app / Travel Service.** The adapter only supplies flight data.
- **Provider is swappable** via `PROVIDER` var + one new adapter file; the Worker,
  Travel Service and UI are untouched.
- **Flexible-date search is provider-independent** (Travel Service enumerates date
  pairs, bounded + concurrency-limited, and asks the adapter for the cheapest offer per pair).
- **Daily checks + alerts:** the Worker's `scheduled()` handler runs on a Cron
  Trigger (`wrangler.jsonc → triggers.crons`), persists real snapshots to **KV**,
  and fires alerts through the notifier seam.
- **Persistence:** Cloudflare **KV** (`env.KV`), no external DB.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `flight-tracker.html` | UI. Calls `/api/travel` only. Honest states when not configured. |
| `src/worker.js` | Cloudflare Worker: `fetch` (API + static assets) + `scheduled` (cron). |
| `src/lib/travelService.js` | Validation, normalization, best-combination rule, flexible-date enumeration. |
| `src/lib/providers/flightProvider.js` | Provider interface + normalized types + registry. |
| `src/lib/providers/duffelAdapter.js` | Duffel implementation (offer_requests + mapping). |
| `src/lib/store.js` | Persistence — `createStore(env.KV)` (KV, memory fallback). |
| `src/lib/notifier.js` | Alert delivery seam (log default; email seam). |
| `wrangler.jsonc`, `.assetsignore`, `package.json`, `.env.example` | Config. |

## Go live (what's required)

1. **Create a Duffel account** at <https://app.duffel.com> → **Developer → Access
   tokens** → create a token (test starts `duffel_test_`, live `duffel_live_`).
2. **Create a KV namespace** and paste its id into `wrangler.jsonc` → `kv_namespaces`:
   ```
   npx wrangler kv namespace create KV
   ```
3. **Set the Duffel token as a Worker Secret** (never committed):
   ```
   npx wrangler secret put DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```
   Non-secret vars (`PROVIDER`, `DUFFEL_VERSION`, `SITE_ORIGIN`, `NOTIFY_CHANNEL`)
   are in `wrangler.jsonc → vars`.
4. **Deploy the Worker:**
   ```
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```
   This uploads the Worker + static assets and registers the Cron Trigger.
5. Open the site, go to the Flight Tracker, pick a strategy, **Check live fares** →
   real Duffel data.

### Local development
- `npx wrangler dev` runs the Worker (API + assets) locally with your vars/secrets.
- A plain static file server serves the UI but **not** `/api/travel`; the UI then
  correctly shows "Travel Service not reachable" and no prices — by design.

## Switching provider
Add `src/lib/providers/<name>Adapter.js` implementing `FlightProvider`, register it
in `getProvider()`, set `PROVIDER=<name>`. The Worker, Travel Service and UI are
untouched. The normalized `FlightOffer` model is what the app consumes.

## Future: hotels & transfers
Same pattern — add a `HotelProvider` interface + adapter behind the Travel Service.

## Notes on data ownership
- **Historical price tracking is ours:** every check writes a real snapshot to KV;
  the chart/lowest/average/trend are computed from those.
- **Alerts** are computed from real fares; delivery is a pluggable channel
  (`log` by default; wire an email provider to enable email).
- **Rate limits:** the flexible-date search is capped and concurrency-limited; a
  provider 429 is surfaced to the UI as a friendly "try again shortly" message.
- **Airport search:** the origin/destination fields autocomplete via the `places`
  action (Duffel Places suggestions); the Travel Service action set is
  `status · places · cheapestDates · search · priceAnalysis · saveTrip · listTrips · history`.

## Verified end-to-end (Duffel test API)

Confirmed against the live Duffel test API through the real Travel Service:
airport search (e.g. LPQ Luang Prabang), flight search + offer retrieval
(real carriers, flight numbers, cabins, baggage, durations), price tracking /
timeline updates, error handling and loading states. The token is provided only
as the Worker secret `DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (or a git-ignored `.dev.vars` locally);
it is never committed.
